        # MAX_BUILD_PYTHON_VERSION from test_gradle_plugin.
        #
        # For the default Python version, the micro version should be different to the
        # one used by the runtime, because that's required by the integration tests
        # `requires_python` and `marker_python_version`. For all other versions, we let
        # the GitHub runner pick a micro version, which will be faster because it's
        # locally cached.
