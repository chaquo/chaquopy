Gradle plugin
#############

Chaquopy is distributed as a plugin for Android's Gradle-based build system. It can be used in
any app which meets the following requirements:

* In your project's top-level `build.gradle` file, the Android Gradle plugin version
  should be between 4.2 and 8.0. Older versions as far back as 2.2 are supported by
  :doc:`older versions of Chaquopy <../versions>`.

  * The Android plugin may be listed as `com.android.application`, `com.android.library` or
    `com.android.tools.build:gradle`.

.. (extra space)

* `minSdkVersion <https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element>`_ must
  be at least 21. Older versions as far back as 15 are supported by :doc:`older versions of
  Chaquopy <../versions>`.


Basic setup
===========

.. _android-plugin:

Gradle plugin
-------------

In your project's `settings.gradle` or `build.gradle` file, find the repositories list in
`pluginManagement` or `buildscript`, and make sure it includes `mavenCentral()`. If your
project was generated by a recent version of Android Studio, this line should already be there.

.. note:: The following instructions use the `plugins` syntax. If your project uses the
          previous `buildscript` and `apply` syntax, follow the instructions `here
          <../10.0/android.html#android-plugin>`_, but replace the Chaquopy version number with
          the current one shown below.

In your *top-level* `build.gradle` file, set the Chaquopy version:

.. parsed-literal::
    plugins {
        id 'com.chaquo.python' version '|release|' apply false
    }

In the *module-level* `build.gradle` file (usually in the `app` directory), apply the
Chaquopy plugin *after* the Android plugin::

    plugins {
        id 'com.android.application'
        id 'com.chaquo.python'
    }

All other configuration will be done in this module-level `build.gradle`. The examples below
will show the configuration within `defaultConfig`, but it can also be done within a `product
flavor <https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants#product-flavors>`_.

The Chaquopy plugin can also be used in an `Android library module
<https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library>`_ (AAR). However, it can only
be used in one module in a project: either in the app module, or in exactly one library module.
If you use it in multiple modules, the build may fail, and even if it succeeds, only one
module's Python code will be included in the app.

.. _android-abis:

ABI selection
-------------

The Python interpreter is a native component, so you must use the `abiFilters
<https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/gradle-external-native-builds#specify-abi>`_
setting to specify which ABIs you want the app to support. The currently available ABIs are:

* `armeabi-v7a`, supported by virtually all Android devices.
* `arm64-v8a`, supported by most recent Android devices.
* `x86`, for the Android emulator.
* `x86_64`, for the Android emulator.

During development you'll probably want to enable them all, i.e.::

    defaultConfig {
        ndk {
           abiFilters "armeabi-v7a", "arm64-v8a", "x86", "x86_64"
        }
    }

There's no need to actually install the NDK, as all of Chaquopy's native libraries are already
pre-compiled and stripped.

Each ABI will add several MB to the size of the app, plus the size of any native
:ref:`requirements <android-requirements>`. If you find this makes your app too large, see
:ref:`the FAQ <faq-size>`.

.. _python-version:

Python version
--------------

You can set your app's Python version like this::

      defaultConfig {
          python {
              version "3.8"
          }
      }

In :doc:`this version of Chaquopy <../versions>`, the default Python version is 3.8. The
other available versions are 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11, but these may have fewer :ref:`packages
<android-requirements>` available.

.. _buildPython:

buildPython
-----------

Some features require Python 3.7 or later to be available on the build machine. These features
are indicated by a note in their documentation sections.

By default, Chaquopy will try to find Python on the PATH with the standard command for your
operating system, first with a matching minor version, and then with a matching major version.
For example, if :ref:`your app's Python version <python-version>` is 3.8, then:

* On Linux and Mac it will try `python3.8`, then `python3`.
* On Windows, it will try `py -3.8`, then `py -3`.
* On all platforms, it will finally try `python`.

If this doesn't work for you, set your Python command using the `buildPython` setting.
For example, on Windows you might use one of the following::

      defaultConfig {
          python {
              buildPython "C:/path/to/python.exe"
              buildPython "C:/path/to/py.exe", "-3.8"
          }
      }


Development
===========

.. _android-source:

Source code
-----------

By default, Chaquopy will look for Python source code in the `python` subdirectory of each
`source set <https://developer.android.com/studio/build/index.html#sourcesets>`_. For example,
the Python code for the `main` source set should go in `src/main/python`.

To include Python source code from other directories, use the `android.sourceSets
<https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants.html#configure-sourcesets>`_ block.
For example::

    android {
        sourceSets {
            main {
                python.srcDir "some/other/dir"
            }
        }
    }

.. note:: The `setRoot <https://developer.android.com/reference/tools/gradle-api/current/com/android/build/api/dsl/AndroidSourceSet#setroot>`_
          method only takes effect on the standard Android directories. If you want to set the
          Python directory as well, you must do so explicitly, e.g.::

              main {
                  setRoot "some/other/main"
                  python.srcDirs = ["some/other/main/python"]
              }

`As with Java
<https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants.html#sourceset-build>`_, it is
usually an error if the source directories for a given build variant include multiple copies of
the same filename. This is only permitted if the duplicate files are all empty, such as may
happen with `__init__.py`.

.. _android-startup:

Startup
-------

It's important to structure the app so that `Python.start()
<java/com/chaquo/python/Python.html#start(com.chaquo.python.Python.Platform)>`_ is always
called with an `AndroidPlatform <java/com/chaquo/python/android/AndroidPlatform.html>`_ before
attempting to run Python code. There are two basic ways to achieve this:

If the app always uses Python, then call Python.start() from a location which is guaranteed
to run exactly once per process, such as `Application.onCreate()
<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application.html#onCreate()>`_. The
easiest way to do this is to use `PyApplication
<java/com/chaquo/python/android/PyApplication.html>`_, or your own subclass of it. Simply
add the following attribute to the `<application>` element in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

.. code-block:: xml

    android:name="com.chaquo.python.android.PyApplication"

Alternatively, if the app only sometimes uses Python, then call Python.start() after first
checking whether it's already been started:

.. code-block:: java

    // "context" must be an Activity, Service or Application object from your app.
    if (! Python.isStarted()) {
        Python.start(new AndroidPlatform(context));
    }

.. _android-requirements:

Requirements
------------

.. note:: This feature requires Python on the build machine, which can be configured with the
          :ref:`buildPython <buildPython>` setting.

External Python packages may be built into the app using the `pip` block in `build.gradle`.
Within this block, add `install` lines, which can take any of the forms accepted by `pip
install <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/>`_. For example::

    defaultConfig {
        python {
            pip {
                // A requirement specifier, with or without a version number:
                install "scipy"
                install "requests==2.24.0"

                // An sdist or wheel filename, relative to the project directory:
                install "MyPackage-1.2.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl"

                // A directory containing a setup.py, relative to the project
                // directory (must contain at least one slash):
                install "./MyPackage"

                // "-r"` followed by a requirements filename, relative to the
                // project directory:
                install "-r", "requirements.txt"
            }
        }
    }

In our most recent tests, Chaquopy could install over 90% of the top 1000 packages on `PyPI
<https://pypi.org/>`_. This includes almost all pure-Python packages, plus a constantly-growing
selection of packages with native components. To see which native packages are currently
available, you can `browse the repository here <https://chaquo.com/pypi-7.0/>`_. To
request a package to be added or updated, or for any other problem with installing
requirements, please visit our `issue tracker <https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/issues>`_.

To pass options to `pip install`, give them as a comma-separated list to the `options` setting.
For example::

    pip {
        options "--extra-index-url", "https://example.com/private/repository"
        install "MyPackage==1.2.3"
    }

Any options in the `pip documentation <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/>`_ may be
used, except for those which relate to the target environment, such as `--target`, `--user` or
`-e`. If there are multiple `options` lines, they will be combined in the order given.

.. _static-proxy-generator:

Static proxy generator
----------------------

.. note:: This feature requires Python on the build machine, which can be configured with the
          :ref:`buildPython <buildPython>` setting.

The static proxy feature allows a Python class to extend a Java class, or to be referenced
directly in Java code or the `AndroidManifest.xml` file without going through the Java API.

To use this feature, write your Python classes using the syntax described in the
":ref:`static-proxy`" section, then list their containing modules in the `build.gradle` file as
follows::

    defaultConfig {
        python {
            staticProxy "module.one", "module.two"
        }
    }


Packaging
=========

.. _extractPackages:

extractPackages
---------------

At runtime, Python modules are usually loaded directly from the APK, and don’t exist as
separate files. If there are certain packages in your :ref:`source code <android-source>`
or :ref:`requirements <android-requirements>` which need to exist as separate files, you
can do this with the `extractPackages` setting, like this::

    defaultConfig {
        python {
            extractPackages "package1", "package2.subpkg"
        }
    }

Each extracted file will slightly slow down your app's startup, so this setting should be
used on the deepest possible package.

.. _android-data:

Data files
----------

Any data files in your :ref:`source code <android-source>` and :ref:`requirements
<android-requirements>` will be automatically built into your app. You can read them at runtime
using a path relative to `__file__`.

For example, if the data file is in the same directory as the Python file:

.. code-block:: python

    from os.path import dirname, join
    filename = join(dirname(__file__), "filename.txt")

You can then pass this filename to :any:`open`, or any other function which reads a file.

If the data file and the Python file are in different directories, then change the path
accordingly. For example, if the Python file is `alpha/hello.py`, and the data file is
`bravo/filename.txt`, then replace `filename.txt` above with `../bravo/filename.txt`.

Unlike :ref:`Python modules <extractPackages>`, data files are always extracted onto the
filesystem at runtime. However, files stored within a top-level directory containing an
`__init__.py` file will not be extracted until the corresponding Python package is
imported. All other files will be extracted when Python starts.

Do not write any files to these directories at runtime, as they may be deleted when the app is
upgraded. Instead, write files to `os.environ["HOME"]`, as described in the ":ref:`android-os`"
section.

.. _android-bytecode:

Bytecode compilation
--------------------

.. note:: This feature requires Python on the build machine, which can be configured with the
          :ref:`buildPython <buildPython>` setting.

Your app will start up faster if its Python code is compiled to .pyc format, so this is
enabled by default.

If bytecode compilation succeeds, the original .py files will not be included in the APK,
unless they're covered by the :ref:`extractPackages <extractPackages>` setting. However,
this prevents source code text from appearing in stack traces, so during development you
may wish to disable it. There are individual settings for:

* `src`: :ref:`local source code <android-source>`
* `pip`: :ref:`requirements <android-requirements>`
* `stdlib`: the Python standard library

For example, to disable compilation of your local source code::

    defaultConfig {
        python {
            pyc {
                src false
            }
        }
    }

In the case of `src` and `pip`, your :ref:`buildPython <buildPython>` must use the same
bytecode format as Chaquopy itself. Usually this means it must have the same minor version,
e.g. if :ref:`your app's Python version <python-version>` is 3.8, then `buildPython` can be
any version of Python 3.8.

If bytecode compilation fails, the build will continue with a warning, unless you've
explicitly set one of the `pyc` settings to `true`. Your app will still work, but its code will
have to be compiled on the target device, which means it will start up slower and use more
storage space.


Python standard library
=======================

Chaquopy supports the entire Python standard library, except as documented below. If you
discover a problem with any other module, please `let us know
<https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/issues>`_.

.. _stdlib-unsupported:

Unsupported modules
-------------------

The following modules are unsupported because they require OS features which aren't available
on Android:

* :any:`crypt`
* :any:`grp`
* :any:`nis`
* :any:`spwd`

The following modules are unsupported because they require libraries which we don't currently
include:

* :any:`curses`
* :any:`dbm.gnu`
* :any:`dbm.ndbm`
* :any:`readline`
* :any:`tkinter`
* :any:`turtle`

multiprocessing
---------------

Because Android doesn't support POSIX semaphores, most of the :any:`multiprocessing` APIs will
fail with the error "This platform lacks a functioning sem_open implementation". The simplest
solution is to use :any:`multiprocessing.dummy` instead.

.. _android-os:

os
---

Don't pass a simple filename to functions which write a file, as this will try to write to the
current directory, which is usually read-only on Android. Instead, use a path relative to
`os.environ["HOME"]`, like this:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from os.path import join
    filename = join(os.environ["HOME"], "filename.txt")

You can then pass this filename to :any:`open`, or any other function which writes a file.

`os.environ["HOME"]` is set to your app's `internal storage directory
<https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/app-specific>`_. Any files or
subdirectories created in this location will persist until the app is uninstalled.

If your app is `debuggable <https://developer.android.com/studio/debug#enable-debug>`_, you can
read and write this directory from Android Studio using the `Device File Explorer
<https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/device-file-explorer>`_. Its path will be something
like `/data/data/your.application.id/files`.

socket
------

The following functions are unavailable because they're not supported by our minimum
Android version:

* :any:`socket.if_nameindex`
* :any:`socket.if_nametoindex`
* :any:`socket.if_indextoname`

ssl
---

The :any:`ssl` module is configured to use a copy of the CA bundle from `certifi
<https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi/>`_ version 2022.12.7. The system CA store is
not used.

sys
---

:any:`sys.stdout` and :any:`sys.stderr` are redirected to the `Logcat
<https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/am-logcat.html>`__ with the tags
`python.stdout` and `python.stderr` respectively. These streams are line-buffered by
default: if you want to disable that, use :any:`io.TextIOWrapper.reconfigure` to set
`write_through=True`.

This redirection does not affect the native stdout and stderr streams, which may be used
by non-Python libraries. If you want to redirect them as well, see
`AndroidPlatform.redirectStdioToLogcat
<java/com/chaquo/python/android/AndroidPlatform.html#redirectStdioToLogcat()>`_.

By default, :any:`sys.stdin` always returns EOF. If you want to run some code which takes
interactive text input, have a look at the `console app template
<https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy-console>`_.


.. _android-studio-plugin:

Android Studio plugin
=====================

To add Python editing suppport to the Android Studio user interface, you may optionally install
the "Python Community Edition" plugin. However, Chaquopy isn't integrated with this plugin, so
you'll see the warning "No Python interpreter configured for the module", and your code will
probably display many error indicators such as "Unresolved reference" and "No module named".
These are harmless: just go ahead and run your app, and if there really is an error, the
details will be displayed in the `Logcat <https://stackoverflow.com/a/23353174>`__.
